# 🎨 Generative AI - Internship Project (Task 4)

This repository contains my final project for the **Generative AI Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**.

## ✅ Task 4: Image-to-Image Translation using TensorFlow

In this project, I built a basic image-to-image translation pipeline using TensorFlow. The objective was to use a paired dataset and a neural network model to generate output images conditioned on input images.

### 📁 Project Structure

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for development)

### 📌 Key Features
- Preprocessing of paired image datasets
- Use of `tf.data` API for efficient input pipelines
- Visualization of input vs output image pairs
- Clean and reproducible code

### 📸 Sample Output
Check the `sample_outputs/` folder for example results generated by the model.

### 🙌 Acknowledgements
Special thanks to **Prodigy Infotech** for the internship opportunity and guidance during the project.
